 # BERT Multilabel Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a BERT-based model for multilabel classification using TensorFlow. The model is trained on text data and predicts multiple labels for each input example. This README provides an overview of the code structure and steps involved in training and evaluating the model.

## Overview
- Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the training data using the provided CSV file. Tokenize the text data using BERT tokenizer and create input tensors.
- Model Setup: Load a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification and compile it with the necessary optimizer and loss function.
- Model Training: Train the model using the training data. Adjust the number of epochs, batch size, and other parameters as needed.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the test data and calculate test loss and accuracy.
- Saving the Model: Save the trained model and the BERT tokenizer for later use.
- Making Predictions: Load the saved model and tokenizer, preprocess new text data, and use the model to make predictions on the new data.
- Metrics and Visualization: Calculate accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall metrics for the model's predictions. Visualize the confusion matrix.

## Example Usage
The code provided in this repository demonstrates the complete process of training, evaluating, and using the BERT-based model for multilabel classification.

## Note
Make sure to adjust hyperparameters, paths, and other settings according to your specific use case and data.
